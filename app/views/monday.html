<p><b>10am to 11am on 25 September 2023</b></p>
<p>Leveraging data science could be the most effective way for policymakers to make evidence-based decisions. Given changes in policy are 
often associated with interconnected systems such as urban systems, climate change, healthcare provision and social infrastructure, we need a way to 
enable policymakers to connect data across these sectors.</p>
<p>We introduce the Digital Solutions Hub and discuss how integrating environmental; socioeconomic and health data can address policy challenges from national and local scale.</p>

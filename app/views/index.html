      <p class="govuk-body">
        DataConnect is a week-long series of presentations, webinars, show and tells, demonstrations, case studies, discussions and panels. The programme is open, user-generated and mostly delivered online. The Central Digital and Data Office at Cabinet Office and the Data Quality Hub at ONS coordinate DataConnect on behalf of participants.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Any and all data topics are welcome at DataConnect23. We want you to bring your data issues, projects and contexts, technical and non technical - from service delivery, to data science, to interoperability, to algorithms, to access, to linking, to APIs, to standards, to analytics, to ethics, to tooling, to management, to architecture, and beyond.
      </p>


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="bring-it-together">Bring it together</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        To continue to deliver with data and realise our data ambitions, we need to #BringItTogether. ‘Together’ is when we work as multidisciplinary teams, or bridge different systems, maximise interoperability, enable service delivery across organisations or when sharing our data, our skills and our insights. DataConnect is a special opportunity to make those connections between people and programmes; because our work is strengthened and our goals easier to reach when we enable different data initiatives, skills, services, technologies and, most importantly, people, to come together.
